_Similar Applications:_
* https://apps.vinocell.com/en/home - Track the history of your cellar (stored and gone bottles), draw and fill your racks and shelves, record your tasting notes and pro ratings from world guides, and pair dishes for every wine.
* https://www.cellartracker.com/ - CellarTracker is a tool that you can use to track the wines you have tasted as well as the wines you are storing. It provides numerous fields to let you track as little or as much data as you want about your wine collection and tasting history. At the simplest level, you can keep a wishlist or a list of wines you have liked. At the most complex level, you can keep a detailed record of every bottle, along with custom-generated barcodes, and a complete history of every wine you have ever tasted, regardless of whether it came from your cellar.

_API:_

* https://www.globalwinescore.com/api/Global - Wine Score is designed as a REST API for multiple clients : you can use it for your web app on computers as well as any mobile devices.
